# Change Log

## 1.3.2

### Airflow ETL Improvements

- **Automatic dbt retry for transient failures** — `dbt_build` now performs an immediate `dbt retry` when model failures are not known to be permanent (compilation errors, missing columns, permission denied, etc.), reducing flaky DAG failures from transient Trino errors
- **Multi-model test tracking** — tests that reference multiple models (e.g. relationships tests) now record separate entries per dependent model in `dbt_test_dates`, with the MERGE key expanded to `(test_id, model_id, event_date)` for accurate per-model test tracking
- **Robust test result parsing** — `parse_dbt_results` now gracefully falls back to `depends_on.nodes` when `attached_node` is unavailable, and skips tests with no model association instead of writing null model IDs

## 1.3.1

### CTE Partition Filters

- **Automatic partition filters for CTEs** — CTEs that reference upstream models via `from.model` now automatically receive `_ext_event_date_filter` partition predicates, and models that read from CTEs (`from.cte`) also get partition filters by resolving the CTE chain to its root model or source. This makes CTE-based models consistent with ephemeral model chains.
- **CTE-level `exclude_date_filter`** — individual CTEs can opt out of automatic partition filters by setting `"exclude_date_filter": true`, independent of the parent model's setting

## 1.3.0

### Catalog-Agnostic Storage Support

- **Iceberg and Glue/Polaris support** — new `storage_type`, `etl_schema`, and `project_catalog` variables in `dbt_project.yml` enable catalog-agnostic SQL generation across Delta Lake, Iceberg, Hive, and Glue/Polaris
- **Storage-type-aware partitioning** — incremental models automatically use the correct format (`partitioned_by` vs `partition_by`) based on storage type

### Materialization Shorthand

- Simplified syntax for materialization, use `"materialization": "incremental" | "ephemeral"` instead of the full object definition.
- New `dj.materialization.defaultIncrementalStrategy` setting to define global default for incremental materialization shorthand. Can be overridden per model via `materialization.strategy`.
- Enabled strategy field in Model Wizard for incremental models.

### CTE Bulk Select: Exclude/Include Filters and Type Inheritance

- **`exclude`/`include` support for CTE bulk selects** — `all_from_cte`, `dims_from_cte`, and `fcts_from_cte` directives now accept `exclude` and `include` arrays to filter which columns are selected from a CTE, matching the existing support for model-level bulk selects
- **Column type inheritance in CTEs** — when a CTE selects columns as plain strings (e.g. `"select": ["col_a", "col_b"]`), the dim/fct type is now inherited from the parent model or CTE instead of defaulting all columns to `dim`. This ensures `dims_from_cte` and `fcts_from_cte` correctly filter by column type in CTE-to-CTE chains
- **CTE column reference validation** — invalid column names in `exclude`/`include` arrays are now reported as errors in the VS Code Problems tab with the list of available columns, without blocking the sync workflow
- **Column lineage accuracy** — lineage tracing now respects dims/fcts type filters when resolving CTE bulk directives, preventing `fct` columns from appearing in `dims_from_cte` lineage traces (and vice versa)

### CTE group_by Validation for Computed Columns

- **Reject string aliases for computed columns in CTE `group_by`** — using bare string aliases like `["month"]` when `month` is defined with an `expr` (e.g. `DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', col)`) now produces a validation error in the Problems tab instead of silently generating invalid SQL that fails at Trino runtime
- **Recommended pattern documented** — `[{ "type": "dims" }]` is now documented as the recommended `group_by` pattern inside CTEs, automatically resolving computed expressions

### Enhancements

- Support `"dims"` as a top-level string value for `group_by`, equivalent to `[{ "type": "dims" }]`.
- Support `"dims"` as a string value for join `on`, automatically joining on all shared dimension columns.
- Update source and table freshness configuration:
  - Source-level freshness now accepts a config object or null (disables checks for the entire source).
  - Table-level optional freshness property (set to null to disable per-table).
  - Table-level optional `loaded_at_field` to allow overriding the timestamp field.

## 1.2.1

- AGENTS.md and skill files now written to `.agents/dj/` and `.agents/skills/` respectively, instead of `.dj/`

## 1.2.0

### Inline Subquery Support

- **Nested subqueries in WHERE, HAVING, and JOIN ON conditions** — define inline subqueries directly in model JSON with support for 10 operators: `IN`, `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
- **Subquery data sources** — reference models, sources, or CTEs as the subquery's FROM clause, with optional inner WHERE filtering
- **Visual SubqueryEditor** — new reusable UI component with searchable dropdowns for model/source/CTE selection, operator picker, and collapsible layout
- **JOIN ON subqueries** — subquery conditions alongside column and expression conditions in join definitions
- **Schema validation** — new `model.subquery.schema.json` with `$ref` integration into WHERE, HAVING, and JOIN schemas

### Enhancements

- Improved JOIN node headers with `override_alias` support and cleaner layout
- Added a `from.rollup` property to `int_select_model` and `int_join_models`, enabling time-grain re-aggregation alongside explicit column selection and joins. This provides the functionality of `int_rollup_model` with greater control over dimensions and custom expressions.
- Added selective model execution for deferred runs. Users can now choose which modified models to include when running with `--defer`, instead of running all changed models.
- Refactored AI agent integration to use agent-agnostic skill files (Agent Skills open standard) instead of agent-specific prompts
- Removed unnecessary activation events for faster extension startup
- `dj.codingAgent` setting now accepts `boolean` (recommended) with legacy string values deprecated
- Updated AGENTS.md template and skill files with documentation for inline CTEs, subqueries, and `from.rollup`

### Fixes

- Fixed crash in JOIN ON processing when `on` is undefined (cross joins)
- Fixed schema compliance by omitting `on` property for cross joins in `buildJoinUpdate`
- Resolved an issue where column metadata (descriptions, tags, and partition configs) failed to propagate through CTEs
- Fix Data Explorer showing stale results when changing the selected model in Data Modeling; now auto-refreshes columns and clears previous query results on model change

## 1.1.0

- Added an optional case_sensitive field at the model and field levels for explicit overrides; global default is managed via Lightdash config
- Fixed: Filter out inherited Lightdash metrics that reference unavailable columns during YAML generation

## 1.0.1 (March 19, 2026)

- Added a confirmation dialog when creating a model to resume a saved draft or start fresh

## 1.0.0 (March 2026)
