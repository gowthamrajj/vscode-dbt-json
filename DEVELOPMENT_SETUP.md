## Prerequisites

### General Environment

For general environment setup (Trino, Java, dbt, etc.), see the **[Setup Guide](docs/setup/setup.md)**.

### Development Tools

For development, you'll also need:

- **Node.js** (v20.x - v22.x LTS recommended)
- **npm** (10.x or higher)
- **VS Code** (version 1.87.0 or higher)

### Extension Development Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Workday/vscode-dbt-json.git
cd vscode-dbt-json
npm install
```

### Running the Extension Locally

#### Method 1: Extension Development Host (Recommended for development)

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Start development watchers (optional, for auto-rebuild):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
4. Open a dbt project in the new VS Code window
5. Make changes and press `Cmd+Shift+F5` to reload

#### Method 2: Package and Install

1. Build and package the extension:

   ```bash
   npm run package # This will automatically run vscode:prepublish beforehand
   ```

2. Install the generated VSIX file:

   ```bash
   code --install-extension dj-framework-*.vsix
   ```

### Development Scripts

| Command                   | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`             | Start all watchers (TypeScript, web, tests) |
| `npm run watch:esbuild`   | Watch and rebuild extension JS with esbuild |
| `npm run watch:test`      | Watch and run tests                         |
| `npm run watch:tsc`       | Watch TypeScript compilation (extension)    |
| `npm run watch:web-build` | Watch and build web assets (Vite build)     |
| `npm run watch:web-tsc`   | Watch TypeScript compilation (web)          |

### Debugging

- **Extension logs**: View → Output → "DJ"
- **Reload extension**: `Cmd+Shift+F5` in Extension Development Host
- **Webview debugging**: Developer → Open Webview Developer Tools
- **Full reload**: Developer → Reload Window

## Making Changes

### Project Structure

The root folder's `package.json` contains configuration read by Microsoft's Visual Studio Code Extension Manager (vsce). The `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` will be rendered within VSCode as part of the extension description.

- Root

  - `src/` — Extension source (TypeScript)
  - `web/` — Vite React app rendered in VS Code webviews
  - `macros/` — SQL macros shipped and written into the active dbt project
  - You can change where macros are written using the VS Code setting `dj.dbtMacroPath`. This is a subfolder relative to the `macro-paths` defined in your project's `dbt_project.yml`.
  - `schemas/` — JSON Schemas used for validation and TS type generation
  - `tests/` — Test files and fixtures
    - `fixtures/` — Test fixtures and reference data
    - `update-fixtures.ts` — Script to generate test fixtures from dbt projects
  - `scripts/` — Build and utility scripts
  - `dist/` — Built extension (`dist/extension`) and web assets (`dist/web`)

- `src/`

  - `extension.ts` — Extension activation/deactivation entry
  - `admin.ts` — VS Code platform helpers (e.g., `WORKSPACE_ROOT`, `runProcess`, schema/sql paths, `IS_LOCAL` handling)
  - `services/`
    - `api.ts` — Routes API messages to services
    - `coder.ts` — Core controller: wiring, commands, file watching, webview messaging
    - `dbt.ts` — dbt project discovery, manifest parsing, tree views, hovers
    - `framework.ts` — JSON↔SQL/YML sync logic, validation, webview-backed create flows
    - `lightdash.ts` — Preview command integration
    - `trino.ts` — Trino queries, tree view, query view wiring
  - `shared/` — Cross-environment utilities and types (`api/`, `coder/`, `dbt/`, `framework/`, `git/`, `sql/`, `trino/`, `web/`)
  - `shared/schema/types/` — Generated from `schemas/` via `npm run schema`

- `web/`

  - Vite app (React 18). Output is configured in `web/vite.config.ts` to `../dist/web` (`assets/main.js`, `assets/main.css`)
  - Key dirs: `context/`, `elements/`, `forms/`, `pages/`, `styles/`

- `schemas/`

  - Authoritative JSON Schemas for `.model.json` / `.source.json`
  - Regenerate TS types with `npm run schema`

- `macros/`

  - Macro files copied into the active dbt project on activation so dbt resolves them

## Testing

### TypeScript Tests

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run watch:test
```

### Updating Test Fixtures

To update test fixtures with new reference data:

```bash
npm run fixtures:update
```
